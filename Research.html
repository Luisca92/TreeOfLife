      <h2>The Case for Tropical Forest Restoration</h2>
      <div class="ResearchText" style="font-size:2vw;text-align:left"
      <p>Tropical forests are recognized worldwide as extraordinary 
          reservoirs of biodiversity that reach their highest levels 
          of diversity in approach to the equator. Their structure and
          diversity provides a myriad of ecosystem services to human communities 
          including but not limited to: carbon sequestration, erosion regulation,
          storm protection, water supply, crop pollination, nutrient cycling, 
          ethnobotanic medicine, physiological health enhancement, and the 
          goods and services recognized by markets such as timber and fruit). 
          In the Neotropics, deforestation is driven primarily by the demand
          for cattle pasture, and in these landscapes, it is often unreasonable
          to demand these landscapes return to a continuous forest cover
          (this land belongs to someone!). Establishing <strong>restoration 
          plantings</strong> is one way to reconcile our conservation goals and 
          local land-use needs. Restoration plantings can be established as a
          set of "tree islands" that act as stepping-stones for local fauna and
          yield ecosystem services to local landowners. Since most tree species
          in the tropics are animal-dispersed, it is possible for these plantings
          to continue developing and provide resources and habitat to additional
          forest fauna threatened by deforestation.

                            My PhD research focused on evaluating how species selection in
                            tropical restoration plantings influenced the development of forest
                            structure and the return of biodiversity. These plantings were established
                            in 2006 by Drs. Henry F. Howe and Cristina Martínez-Garza in Los Tuxtlas, 
                            Veracruz, México. The experiment is composed of 24 (30x30m) fenced plots 
                            separated by 35 m of actively grazed pasture on a hillside gradient. 
                            Plots belong to three treatments: (A) plots planted
                            with animal-dispersed trees, (W) plots planted with 
                            wind-dispersed trees, and (C) unplanted plots to simulate
                            natural succession.   </p>

                The main hypothesis is that the plantings
                with animal-dispersed species will attract more dispersal agents,
                enhancing seed rain, eventually seedling establishment, 
                ultimately accelerating ecological succession.

                            Where tropical forests are fragmented by cattle pasture or other agricultural practices, 
                            the characteristics of local dispersal agents can determine 
                            whether a particular plant species is able to colonize 
                            new forest fragments or not. We characterize as <strong>
                            effective restoration agents</strong> those species that 
                            possess characteristics that maximize their contribution
                            to the development of tropical forests in fragmented landscapes (Figure 2).
                            The characteristics that define them are: 

                            <ul>
                                <li>High quantity of dispersed seeds</li>

                              </ul>
                            
                            The issue is, these effective 
                            restoration agents are often:
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>A small subset of the available

                                <li>Large-bodied and therefore more
                                    threatened by hunting, the pet trade, and other anthropogenic

                            </ul>
                            The result is what we describe as <strong>"restoration frailty"</strong> -- 
                            restoration plantings may be less likely to develop because of how 
                            disproportionately important and endangered these effective restoration agents are.

        <p>When hunting brings about local extinction of effective 
            restoration agents or seed dispersal is generally limited, 
            the behavior and abundance of dispersal agents that are not 
            crossing over from the forest should be evaluated. 
            Behavioral sampling will allow restorations to be modified 
            in a manner that will enhance seed dispersal by unparticipating
            dispersers. Increasing the size of the plantings and 
            minimizing the intervening distance can help, 
            but these too are not panaceas to dispersal limitation
            or simple modifications. Alternatively, supplementing fruit
            production by establishing hub tree species (e.g., <i>Cecropia</i> sp.) in the plantings,
            or erecting bird perches and/or artificial bat roosts can 
            substantially increase seed dispersal at disturbed sites can 
            potentially safeguard the development of restoration plantings.

        <h2>Recalcitrant Understory Layers in Restoration</h2>
        <p>Crucial to the development of restoration plantings surrounded
            by pasture is fencing to prevent cattle from herbivorizing
            recruiting seedlings. However, fences will protect plants 
            indiscriminately, including unwanted exotics.</p>

                            Under favorable light

                            the understory includes an invasive fern species, the

        <p>   
                Has a recalcitrant understory layer formed in our restoration plots? 
                We sought to evaluate the extent and the effects of this invasion to
                determine which factors influenced invasibility. 
                To do this we randomly established 16 1m<sup>2</sup> quadrats per plot and counted the 
                number of fronds within each quadrat and assessed the recruiting 
                plant community. We also recorded the presence of grass 
                or hemiepiphytic lianas in the quadrats as percent cover 
                where present, measured the length of five
                randomly-selected fronds per quadrat, and took measures of canopy cover. 
                We predicted that frond density and length would be highest
                in plots with less canopy cover, which given the experimental 
                design would follow this pattern: animal < wind < natural succession. <br><br>

                    than the wind-plantings (Figure 4). The animal-plantings had lower frond
                    density and shorter fronds than the wind-plantings. Frond density correlated
                    strongly with frond length, indicating that <i>N. brownii</i> indeed behaves

        <h2>Return of Biodiversity & Development of Forest Structure in Tropical Restoration Plantings</h2>
        <p> How do you evaluate restoration success? If the most defining feature of the tropics is its
            high species richness, should we simply strive for the highest species count regardless of whether the species are native or not? Or, if we are
            restoring an area, lets say to prevent landslides, can we simply select any species for the job and call it a restored site?
            Sure, you could if the intention is solving a very
            specific problem or simply giving the illusion of solution to a more serious one (e.g., the Colombian military dropping
            tree seeds from a Black Hawk helicopter to seem environmentally-friendly). 
            If your objective is in fact to restore a site 
            for the purpose of restoring ecosystem services and native habitat, 
            then this is a different matter that requires 
            you evaluate your restoration using a <strong>reference 
            ecosystem</strong> such as a primary forest. 
            This reference ecosystem and your restored site can then 
            be evaluated by three ecological attributes:
            species abundance and composition, forest structure, and ecological
            functioning. While restored sites may never entirely resemble the 
            reference ecosystems, approximating its ecological attributes
            is more likely to restore its ecosystem services. Even with this framework however,
            there are still questions about which species we should select to kick-start a
            tropical forest restoration. In our experiment in Los Tuxtlas, we sought to evaluate 
            how planting animal-dispersed trees over wind-dispersed trees 
            influences restoration success.  

            <br><br>
            
            In 2019, I conducted a census where I recorded the circumference, identity, and origin (planted or recruited) 
            of every woody plant and palm (>2m tall) in the 24 restoration plots and 8 additional plots
            established in the forest in June and July 2019 for a total of 7209 trees.
            The objective was to compare the four habitats by the ecological attributes of species abundance & composition and forest structure.
            The prediction was the animal-plantings would resemble the forest the most, while natural sucession would resemble the forest the least.

                        Forest structure we compared by tree basal area, plot basal area (Figure 6), and basal area distribution by size class. 
                        In addition, to visualize the vertical structure, we used diameter as a proxy for height and calculated the proportion of
                        basal area provided by the 10 most common plant families by height class (Figure 7).

            Despite having similar plot basal area, the animal-plantings more closely approximated the 
            forest in tree basal area than the wind-plantings, supporting our hypothesis. However,
            what this reflects is a higher tree count in the wind-plantings. When we compared recruited biodiversity,
            we found that the wind-plantings had more pioneer and non-pioneer plants than the forest. Since
            previous seed rain data did not suggest differences in seed rain between planting treatments, 
            it seems that the difference between the two are likely due to differences in factors that influence
            establishment limitation (e.g., canopy cover, colonizable space, etc). We expect differences due to dispersal 
            limitation differences to manifest once more trees planted in the animal-dispersed treatment begin to bear fruit.

            In comparing vertical structure
            we found that again the animal-plantings approximated the forest the most, particularly because of the 
            Moraceous canopy cover (due to experimental design). The strong similarities in the understory of the restoration 
            treatments reflect the high connectivity among the experimental plots, as the species
            that conform the common understory families are mostly pioneer, biotically-dispersed, small-seeded species that fruit early in life (Figure 7).

            Proportion of basal area provided by the ten most common plant families in each habitat by height rank. 
            Trees were classified into height rank using diameter values, which correlate strongly with tree height, on a log scale to adjust for differences in max canopy height among habitats.</p>
